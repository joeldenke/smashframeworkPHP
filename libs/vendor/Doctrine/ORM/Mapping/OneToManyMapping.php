/**
 * Represents a one-to-many mapping.
 * 
 * NOTE: One-to-many mappings can currently not be uni-directional (one -> many).
 * They must either be bidirectional (one <-> many) or unidirectional (many -> one).
 * In other words, the many-side MUST be the owning side and the one-side MUST be
 * the inverse side.
 *
 * <b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b>
 *
 * The fields of this class are only public for 2 reasons:
 * 1) To allow fast, internal READ access.
 * 2) To drastically reduce the size of a serialized instance (private/protected members
 *    get the whole class name, namespace inclusive, prepended to every property in
 *    the serialized representation).
